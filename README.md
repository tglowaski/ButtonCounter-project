# Button-counter

## DUE: 03 Jan 2018

## Instructions:

Create an app that has three buttons, one for incrementing a counter, one for decrementing the counter, and one for resetting the counter to 0. The counter must be displayed as a **TextView** and must retain its state when the phone is rotated between portrait and landscape modes. There should be no values, such as strings, dimensions, etc. hardcoded in the .java files. They should be maintained and accessed from the appropriate resource files.

### TODO:
1. Open Android Studio and create an Android project named Button-counter-\<yourLastName\>.
2. Edit .gitignore file and put the neccessary file names that do not belong in GitHub.
3. Create a README.md and put '\#README' in it.
4. VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on GitHub. Use 'Initial Commit' as commit message.
5. Verify files were uploaded to your GitHub account.
6. Complete the project.
7. Commit and Push your completed project code to GitHub.
8. Print out any source and resource files (in a readable manner) along with screenshots of app working to hand in. Highlight your WOW factors if you have any.
 
 
 ### Grading:
 
 The above requirements are for a 'B'. In order to achieve an 'A', then you must implement a **WOW** factor. This is normally something that you will have to think of and research how to do it yourself. For this first assignment, styling would be considered. 
 
 ***Note:*** Any issues you have with either the GitHub steps or Java/Android questions should be asked publically on Slack. If you have a question, chances are someone else does also. If you see someone has posted a question on Slack and you know the answer, please chime in and answer.
